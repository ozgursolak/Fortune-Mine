Question2: How does NodeJS handle more than one request at the same time while it is a single thread?

Answer:
NodeJS event loops are only single-threaded. The entire NodeJS architecture is not single-threaded.
There is EventQueue and listener for that which is named as EventLoop.

Cluster module or worker_thread module can run events paralelly if the system is multicore.
